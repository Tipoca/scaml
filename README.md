# SCaml, Smart Contract Abstract Machine Language.

## Strict subset of OCaml

SCaml is a **strict** subset of OCaml programming language.
All the valid SCaml programs are also valid as OCaml programs.
This immediately leads to the following benefits:

* Many OCaml programming tools can be used for SCaml for free.
* SCaml programs are also compilable as OCaml code, which can simulate the behaviour.
* Users can use the existing OCaml programming language tutorials and references to learn SCaml.
